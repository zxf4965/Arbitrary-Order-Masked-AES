/***************************************************************************
 * Implementation of Protected n-share AES-128 in C
 * 
 * This code is an implementation of a protected n-share AES-128 using 
 * compiled gadgets with the expanding circuit compiler introduced in:
 * 
 * "Random Probing Security: Verification, Composition, Expansion and New 
 * Constructions"
 * By Sonia Belaïd, Jean-Sébastien Coron, Emmanuel Prouff, Matthieu Rivain, 
 * and Abdul Rahman Taleb
 * In the proceedings of CRYPTO 2020.

 * Modifications date: December 2024
 * 
 * Description of modifications:
 * - Enhanced `gadgets.c` by implementing an iterable gadget to improve functionality.
 * - Updated the implementation of the `void exp254_sharing(uint8_t *x, uint8_t * out)` function in `aes128_sharing.c` to change the order of the addition chain.
